# httpGo

### Synopsis (What the heck is httpGo and why should I care?)

A simple webserver written in Golang inspired in part by https://httpbin.org/ - an awesome tool used for inspecting http requests/responses. 

httpGo is barebones, containerized, and currently building on CircleCI.

Thanks for stopping by!
